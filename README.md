# Conformal inference and neural networks models with survey data to diagnose and predict the risk of Diabetes Mellitus in the American population

Complex survey designs are common in many crucial medical cohorts. In these instances, it is imperative to develop case-specific predictive risk score models that incorporate the characteristics of the sample design. This is essential to mitigate potential biases in the study results. The objectives of this paper are as follows: i) We propose a general framework based on neural network modeling that integrates survey weights into the estimation process. ii) We introduce a conformal inference methodology tailored for complex survey design data to quantify the uncertainity of the model. iii) We apply this methodology to create a reliable risk score model for detecting diabetes mellitus in the general population. Specifically, we illustrate our approach using data from the NHANES 2011-2014 cohort. In this context, we fit models with varying costs and clinical complexities, yielding new clinical insights and unbiased models.The introduced methodology's applicability can be extended to create predictive models for various diseases and another  medical cohorts.
